            <h2>About Arnold</h2>
            <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is a legendary figure in both bodybuilding and the film industry. Born in Austria in 1947
                , he rose to fame as a bodybuilder in the 1970s, winning numerous titles including Mr. Olympia. He then 
                transitioned into acting, becoming one of the biggest action stars of the 1980s and 1990s with iconic roles
                 in movies like "The Terminator," "Predator," and "Total Recall." In addition to his entertainment career,
                  Schwarzenegger served as the Governor of California from 2003 to 2011. He continues to be active in various
                   philanthropic efforts and remains an influential figure in popular culture.</p>
       
       <p>Schwarzenegger was known as the Styrian Oak, or Austrian Oak, in the bodybuilding world, where he dwarfed his competition.
         He won his first amateur Mr. Universe title in 1967. After moving to California in 1968 to train and compete in 
         bigger events in the United States, he won three more Mr. Universe titles and then the professional Mr. Olympia title
          six years in a row (1970–75) before retiring. He surprised the bodybuilding world by returning to competition one 
          more time to claim the Mr. Olympia title in 1980. Bodybuilding was the subject of several of his books, including 
          the autobiographical Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder 
        (1977; written with Douglas Kent Hall) and The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding (1998; written with Bill 
        Dobbins). </p>
