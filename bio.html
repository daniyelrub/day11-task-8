        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen was born on 30 November 1990 in Tønsberg, Norway. He became a grandmaster in 2004 and has been a dominant figure in the world of chess.</p>

    <p> <b>Childhood</b>
        Carlsen was born in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990[8][9] to Sigrun Øen, a chemical engineer, and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant.[10] The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum.[11] Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age. At two years, he could solve 500-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14.[12]
        
        His father, a keen amateur chess player,[13] taught him to play at age five, although he initially showed little interest in it.[14] He has three sisters, and in 2010 stated that one thing that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.[15]

    <p>The first chess book Carlsen read was a booklet named Find the Plan by Bent Larsen,[16] and his first book on openings was Eduard Gufeld's The Complete Dragon.[17] Carlsen developed his early chess skills playing by himself for hours on end—moving the pieces around, searching for combinations, and replaying games and positions his father showed him. Simen Agdestein emphasises Carlsen's exceptional memory, stating that he was able to recall the locations, populations, flags and capitals of all the countries in the world by age five. Later, he memorised the locations, populations, coats-of-arms and administrative centres of "virtually all" 356 Norwegian municipalities.[18] He participated in his first tournament—the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship—at 8 years and 7 months, and scored 6/11.[19]

        Carlsen was coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country's top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein,[10] who in turn cites Norwegian football manager Egil "Drillo" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy.[20] In 2000, Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later International Master (IM) and Grandmaster (GM),[21] as Ringdal served a one-year siviltjeneste (an alternative civilian service programme) at the college.
        
        Over the course of that year, Carlsen's rating rose from 904 in June 2000 to 1907. His breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000, where he scored 3½/5 against the country's top junior players and gained a tournament performance rating (TPR) of around 2000.[22] Apart from chess, which he studied about three to four hours a day, his favourite pastimes included playing football and reading Donald Duck comics.[23] He also practised skiing until age ten.[24]
        
        From autumn 2000 to the end of 2002, Carlsen played almost 300 rated tournament games, as well as in several blitz tournaments, and participated in other minor events.[25] In October 2002, he placed sixth in the European Under-12 Championship in Peñiscola.[26] The following month, he tied for first place in the 2002 World Under-12 Championship in Heraklion, placing second to Ian Nepomniachtchi on tiebreak.[27] He then obtained three IM norms in relatively quick succession: the first at the January 2003 Gausdal Troll Masters (score 7/10, 2453 PR); the second at the June 2003 Salongernas IM-tournament in Stockholm (6/9, 2470 PR); and the third at the July 2003 Politiken Cup in Copenhagen (8/11, 2503 PR). He was officially awarded the IM title on 20 August 2003.[28]
        
        After finishing primary school, Carlsen took a year off to participate in international chess tournaments in Europe during the autumn of 2003, then returned to complete secondary education at a sports school.[29][30] During the year away from school, he placed joint-third in the European Under-14 Championship[31] and ninth in the 2003 World Under-14 Championship.[32]</p>
