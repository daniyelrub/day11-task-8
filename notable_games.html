    </div></li>

   <li><div class="container">
    Carlsen vs. Garry Kasparov, Reykjavík Rapid (2004), Queen's Gambit Declined:
     Cambridge Springs Defense (D52), ½–½.[games 1] At the age of just 13 years, Carlsen had serious winning chances in a rapid game against Kasparov,[39] who was ranked No. 1 in the world at that time.[501]
Carlsen vs. Veselin Topalov, M-Tel Masters (2009), Semi-Slav Defense: General (D43), 1–0.[games 2] This was Carlsen's first win against a 2800+ player.[502]
</div></li>
<li><div class="container">
    Carlsen vs. Boris Gelfand, Tal Memorial (2011), Slav Defense: Quiet Variation. Schallopp Defense (D12), 1–0.[503][games 3] The No. 1 Israeli player creates a seemingly decisive rook invasion into White's back rank, 
    but Carlsen vanquishes the threats. Carlsen called it "one of the most interesting games I have played in recent times".[504]
    Carlsen vs. Hikaru Nakamura, London Chess Classic (2011), Italian Game: Classical Variation. Giuoco Pianissimo (C53), 1–0.[games 4] Facing the No. 1 American player, Carlsen sacrifices the exchange to achieve a winning position in an otherwise near-equal game.
</div></li>
<li><div class="container">
    Carlsen vs. Viswanathan Anand, Bilbao Masters (2012), Sicilian Defense: Canal Attack. Main Line (B52), 1–0.[games 5] Playing against the then-World Champion
    , Carlsen sacrifices a pawn to leave Black with a cramped position, which leads to Anand's resignation at move 30. Carlsen stated in 2013 that he considers this game to be one of his very best.[505]
Carlsen vs. Li Chao, Qatar Masters (2015), Neo-Grünfeld Defence: Goglidze Attack (D70), 1–0.[games 6] Playing against one of the leading Chinese GMs, Carlsen finds a winning attack by sacrificing his queen in a sharp position.

    Carlsen vs. Ian Nepomniachtchi, 2021 World Championship game 6 (2021), Queen's Pawn Game, Symmetrical Variation, Pseudo-Catalan, 1–0. Game 6 was a 136-move win for Carlsen that lasted 7 hours 45 minutes. As of 2023, it is the longest game in the history of the World Chess Championship, surpassing the previous record, a 124-move draw in game 5 of the World Chess
     Championship 1978 between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi.

    Carlsen won the Chess Oscars from 2009 to 2013. The Chess Oscar, organised by the Russian chess magazine 64, was awarded to the year's best player according to a worldwide poll of leading chess critics, writers, and journalists, but it was no longer awarded after 2013, as 64 ceased publication.[452][453]
    
    The Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang (VG) has awarded Carlsen the "Name of the Year" (Årets navn) twice, in 2009[454] and 2013.[455] VG also named him "Sportsman of the Year" in 2009.[456] Carlsen has also won the Folkets Idrettspris, a people's choice award from the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, in 2009[457] and 2010.[458]
    
    In 2011, he was awarded the Peer Gynt Prize, a Norwegian prize awarded annually to "a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society".[459]
    
    In 2013, Time magazine named Carlsen one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[460]
