            <h2>Early Life and Bodybuilding Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger's passion for bodybuilding began at a young age. He started weight training at the age of 15 and quickly made a name for himself in the sport. In 1968, at the age of 20, he won the Mr. Universe title, becoming the youngest person ever to achieve the feat. This victory marked the beginning of his illustrious bodybuilding career, which would see him dominate the sport for years to come.</p>

                At the same time, his governorship was encumbered by the state’s enormous budget deficit, which ballooned to $26 
                billion in 2009. Despite a battery of service reductions and salary cuts enacted to stem the fiscal crisis, the
                 state’s economy continued to struggle, and Schwarzenegger suffered from consistently low approval ratings. Because
                  of term limits, he did not run for reelection in 2010. In May 2011 Schwarzenegger and Shriver announced that they 
                  were separating; a few days later it was revealed 
                that he had fathered a child with a woman who had worked in the household staff. Shriver subsequently filed for
                 divorce.
