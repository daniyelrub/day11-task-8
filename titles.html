        <p>Magnus Carlsen is a five-time World Chess Champion, a five-time World Rapid Chess Champion
            , and a seven-time World Blitz Chess Champion.
            In the January 2006 FIDE rankings, at the age of 15 years and 32 days, Carlsen attained a 2625 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2600 (the record has since been broken by Wesley So, Wei Yi, and John M. Burke).[461] In the July 2007 FIDE rankings, at the age of 16 years and 213 days, Carlsen attained a 2710 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2700 (the record has since been broken by Wei Yi).[462]

            On 5 September 2008, after winning in round 4 of the Bilbao Masters, Carlsen, aged 17 years and 280 days old, briefly became No. 1 on the unofficial live ratings list.[463][464] Carlsen's victory in the 2009 Nanjing Pearl tournament raised his FIDE rating to 2801, making him, aged 18 years and 336 days, at the time the youngest player ever to surpass 2800[87] (a record subsequently broken by Alireza Firouzja).[465] The youngest before Carlsen to achieve this feat was Vladimir Kramnik at the age of 25,[466] and up until this point only Kasparov, Topalov, Kramnik, and Anand had achieved a 2800+ rating.[467]
            
            The FIDE rankings in January 2010 recorded Carlsen's rating at 2810, which made him No. 1 rated player in the world.[468] This meant that Carlsen became, at the age of 19 years and 32 days, the youngest ever world No. 1, as well as the first player from a Western nation to reach the top of the FIDE rankings since Bobby Fischer in 1971.[469][470][471]
            
            The March 2010 FIDE rankings showed Carlsen with a new peak rating of 2813, a figure that only Kasparov had bettered at that time.[101] On the January 2013 FIDE rankings, Carlsen reached 2861, thus surpassing Garry Kasparov's 2851 record from July 1999.[138][139] In the May 2014 rankings, Carlsen achieved an all-time high record of 2882,[472] with a peak of 2889 on the live ratings list achieved on 21 April 2014.[473] In August 2019 he equalled his peak FIDE rating of 2882.[474]
            
            As of February 2024, Carlsen is also ranked No. 1 in the FIDE rapid rating list with a rating of 2823, and No. 1 in the FIDE blitz rating list with a rating of 2886.[475]
