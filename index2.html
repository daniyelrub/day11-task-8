                <h3>1982–2003: Action superstar</h3>
                Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a 
                box-office hit.[12] This was followed by a sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984, although it was not as 
                successful as its predecessor.[68] In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video Carnival in Rio.[69]
                 In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character in James Cameron's science fiction action film
                  The Terminator.[12][31][70] It has been called his acting career's signature role.[71] Following this, 
                  Schwarzenegger made another sword and sorcery film, Red Sonja, in 1985.[68] During the 1980s, audiences had an 
                  appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars.[31]
                   During the Schwarzenegger-Stallone rivalry they attacked each other in the press, and tried to surpass the other
                    with more on-screen killings and larger weapons.[72] Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor,
                     separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s,
                 such as Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), and Red Heat (1988).
