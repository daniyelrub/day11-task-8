    <h1>career</h1>
    <div class="container">
       
        <p>Magnus Carlsen's chess career began at a young age. He became a grandmaster in 2004 and achieved the
             No. 1 ranking in the FIDE world rankings in January 2010.
    Carlsen made headlines after his victory, at the age of 13, in the C group at the 2004 Corus chess tournament in Wijk
     aan Zee.[33] He obtained a score of 10½/13, losing just one game (against the highest-rated player of the C group, 
     Duško Pavasovič).[34] As a result, he earned his first GM norm, and achieved a PR of 2702. Particularly notable was
      his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round, when he sacrificed material to give mate in just 29 moves.[35]
       His victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in 2005, and it led Lubomir Kavalek, writing for 
       the Washington Post, to give him the title "the Mozart of chess" (although, as pointed out by Edward Winter, the 
       nickname had been given to many illustrious predecessors).[36] Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory
        and played an 
        unusually wide range of openings.[37] Carlsen's prowess caught the attention of Microsoft, which became his
         sponsor.[38] 
    
    2005
        In the Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen International Chess Festival 2004–05, Carlsen defeated 
        Alexei Shirov, then ranked No. 10[43] in the world, as well as the co-winner of the tournament.[44] In the 
        semi-finals of the Ciudad de León rapid chess tournament in June, Carlsen played a four-game match against 
        Viswanathan Anand, who was ranked No. 2 in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid Chess 
        Championship.[45] Anand won 3–1.[46]
        
        In the Norwegian Chess Championship, Carlsen again finished in shared first place, this time with his mentor
         Simen Agdestein. A playoff between them was played between 7 and 10 November. This time, Carlsen had the 
         better tiebreaks, but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores in the event of
          a 1–1 tie had been revoked. The match was closely fought—Agdestein won the first game, Carlsen the 
          second—so it went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner. Carlsen won the 
          first rapid game, Agdestein the second. 
        Then followed three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth 
        rapid game.[47] </p></div>

    <p>2006
        Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first-place finish in Corus group C in 2004. 
        His shared first place with Alexander Motylev with 9/13 (+6−1=6) qualified him to play in the Corus group
         A in 2007.[51]
        
        At the 2006 international 'Bosna' tournament in Sarajevo, Carlsen shared first place with Liviu-Dieter
         Nisipeanu (who won on tiebreak evaluation) and Vladimir Malakhov
        ; this could be regarded as Carlsen's first "A" elite tournament win, although it was not a clear first.[52] 
        2017

        Carlsen at the 79th Tata Steel Chess Tournament, 29 January 2017
        In January, Carlsen participated in the 79th Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He started well, scoring 2 wins and
         4 draws in his first 6 games, but missed mate-in-3 versus Giri in round 7, which Giri described as "the most 
         embarrassing moment" of Carlsen's career.[182] Carlsen then lost in round 8 to Richárd Rapport, and ultimately
          placed second with 8/13 (+4−1=8), one point behind winner Wesley So.[183]
        
        From 13 to 22 April, Carlsen competed in the 4th Grenke Chess Classic, finishing in joint second place, though
         third on tiebreaks, with Fabiano Caruana, with a score of 4/7 (+1−0=6). The clear winner with 5½ points (+4−0=3) 
         was Levon Aronian. As a result, Carlsen's FIDE rating dropped to 2832, his lowest since November 2011 (2826).[184]
        
        Carlsen participated in the fifth edition of Norway Chess from 6 to 16 June. He performed poorly and had a 
        performance rating of 2755, his lowest since 2015 (2670, at the European Team Chess Championship). Ultimately,
         he placed ninth in the round-robin tournament with 4/9 (+1−2=6), losing to Aronian and Kramnik and winning 
         against Karjakin. Aronian won the tournament with 6/9 (+3−0=6).[185]
        
        Carlsen played in the Paris leg of the 2017 Grand Chess Tour, which was held from 21 to 25 June. He finished 
        first in the rapid portion of the tournament with 14/18 (+5−0=4; two points for a win) and fifth in the blitz
         portion with 10/18 (+8−6=4) to place joint first overall with Vachier-Lagrave. Carlsen then defeated 
         Vachier-Lagrave in the playoff to win the tournament.[186]
        
        From 28 June to 2 July, he played in the Leuven leg of the Grand Chess Tour. He won this tournament 
        convincingly, scoring 11/18 (+3−1=5; two points for a win) in the rapid portion and 14½/18 (+12−1=5) in 
        the blitz portion for an overall score of 25½/36, three points ahead of the runner-up, Wesley So.[187] 
        Carlsen's performance rating in the blitz portion of the tournament was 3018, which Garry Kasparov described
         as "phenomenal".[188][non-primary source needed] Additionally, Leonard Barden, writing for The Guardian,
          said the performance was only matched by Fischer's 19/22 score at the 1970 World Blitz Championship.[189]
        
        From 2 to 11 August, Carlsen competed in the Sinquefield Cup, the first classical event of the Grand Chess Tour.
         He finished joint second with Anand, scoring 5½/9 (+3−1=5). He recorded three victories (against Karjakin, So
          and Aronian) and his one loss was to Vachier-Lagrave, who won the tournament with 6/9 (+3−0=6).[190] This result
           left Carlsen in first place in the Grand Chess Tour standings with 34 points, three points ahead of second
            place Vachier-Lagrave.[191]
        
        In September, he took part in the Chess World Cup 2017. His participation in the event as World Champion was
         unusual as the World Cup is part of the cycle to challenge the World Champion in 2018.[192] He defeated
          Oluwafemi Balogun +2−0=0 in the first round to advance to the second round, where he defeated Aleksey
           Dreev +2−0=0. He was then defeated in the third round by Bu Xiangzhi +0−1=1 and eliminated from the 
           tournament.[193]
        
        On 1 October, Carlsen won the Isle of Man Open, a tournament held from 23 September to 1 October. 
        He scored 7½/9 (+6−0=3), half a point ahead of Nakamura and Anand, for a performance rating of 2903. 
        This was Carlsen's first classical tournament victory in 435 days.[194][195]
        
        From 9 to 14 November, Carlsen faced Ding Liren in the 2017 Champions Showdown, a match consisting of 10
         rapid and 20 blitz games, hosted by the Saint Louis Chess Club.[196] Carlsen won, scoring 22–8 (+16−2=12).[197]
        
        From 1 to 11 December, Carlsen competed in the 2017 London Chess Classic, the final event of the 2017 
        Grand Chess Tour. He finished fifth, scoring 5/9 (+2−1=6). Caruana shared first place with Nepomniachtchi 
        on 6/9 (+3−0=6) and won the tournament after defeating Nepomniachtchi 2½–1½ in the blitz tiebreak. 
        Carlsen's placing awarded him 7 additional points in the Grand Chess Tour standings, which was enough
         to crown him the 2017 Grand Chess Tour champion.[198]
        
        From 26 to 30 December, Carlsen played in the 2017 World Rapid and World Blitz Chess Championships,
         held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He finished fifth in the rapid event, scoring 10/15 (+8−3=4). Anand shared
          first place with Vladimir Fedoseev on 10½/15, and won the tournament after defeating Fedoseev on tiebreak.
          [199][200] Carlsen won the blitz event, scoring 16/21 (+13−2=6), one and a half points ahead of his nearest
           competitors, Karjakin and Anand. This was Carlsen's third World Blitz Chess Championship victory.[201]</p>
